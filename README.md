# CS-Forest
Our project is going to be a mix of a 2D platformer and an RPG, where you play as an ATCS student of your choice out of a few. 
You go through a mysterious forest and have to navigate your way through. On your way, you unfortunately experience issues as some ATCS students act as bosses! 
Once you interact with them, an RPG menu opens where you need to fend off the ATCS students to continue your way through the forest. 
There might even be a surprise at the endâ€¦ Mr. Sen is protecting the forest!
