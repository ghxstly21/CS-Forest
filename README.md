# CS-Forest
Our project is going to be a mix of a 2D platformer and an RPG, where you play as an ATCS student, Ryan "Brian" Ortellado  
You go through a mysterious forest and have to navigate your way through. On your way, you unfortunately experience issues as some ATCS students act as bosses! 
To get through the dark forest, you'll need to fend off the ATCS students like Aisha, Big Tommy, and more!
There might even be a surprise at the endâ€¦ Mr. Sen is protecting the forest!

Group: Dharma, Ryan, Sam, Miguel T.
